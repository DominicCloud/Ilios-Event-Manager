# ilios Event-Manager
 
**college Event Management application** complete with a myriad of features, build with Django + Tailwind
Website is built with a minimalistic design by adopting a *neo-brutalism* style

Prominent features include:
- Posting, liking and registering of events
- Sections off userbase between regular Users and College Hosts
- Add-on features such as ratings and review threads on events
- Data Visualisation available for College Hosts

**!Note to run project directly:**
after relocating code, make sure to update the *settings.py* file, in order to update specific variables, namely
EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, SECRET_KEY
You may choose to use values of your own for these variables

After updating these variables, the project should run smoothly :)
